General Info
* We are an organization/developer team who just got an assignment from a company called PetBook who wants us to help them make a new E-commerce for pets with the theme of the 90’s that's going to take on Amazon. Our job is to develop a logical model, erd-diagram and a physical model. The main purpose of the project is not to just make another E-commerce (Like there are already plenty of) because it is going to have some more functionalities. To make PetBook superior to other Ecommerce sites, we have decided to also add a feature where it’s possible for members to socialize with other animal friends, a private message feature and also the possibility to join groups!
